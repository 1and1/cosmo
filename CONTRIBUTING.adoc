== Code Conventions 

* We use "Java Conventions [built-in] - no tabs". If using Eclipse or SpringToolSuite 
it should be fairly easy to find the formatter and apply it.

* Make sure all new `*.java` files to have simple Javadoc class comment with `@author` and
a short description on what the class is for.

* Add self explanatory/comprehensive tests 

* When writing a commit message please follow https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html[these conventions],
  if you are fixing an existing issue please add `Fixes gh-XXXX` at the end of the commit
  message (where `XXXX` is the issue number).
  
== Working with the Code
 
* Make sure maven is installed and enough memory is set. To build the project run
`mvn clean install`
